# GymNote

GymNote is a lightweight, client-side web application for tracking your gym machine workouts. It runs entirely in the browser using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) to store data locallyâ€”no server or build step needed. Just open the `index.html` file in any modern browser (or host it on GitHub Pages) and start logging your progress!

* **Machine List**: Browse and select machines in a scrollable sidebar.
* **Workout Entries**: Log date (defaults to today), weight, reps, and sets per machine.
* **Interactive Charts**: View your progress over time for weight & reps using Chart.js.
